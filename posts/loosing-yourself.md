> First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was
not a Socialist.  
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—  
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—  
Because I was not a Jew.  
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

Martin Niemöller
