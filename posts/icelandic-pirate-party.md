So according to latest [survey](http://www.visir.is/the-pirate-party-is-now-
measured-as-the-biggest-party-in-iceland/article/2015150318848) the Icelandic
Pirate Party is now the largest party in this awesome country. A reason more
to move there, double of reasons to learn from the country that shown so many
examples for society in last 6 years. Are they springing a new great modern
society?
