All these latest deals in Linux world with Microsoft, especially Linux Foundation one, leave a bitter taste.

Let's not lie, they were FLOSS enemies for ever, and I don't think they are changing just adopting to market needs.

They are open sourcing a lot but still they incorporate all high-end things consumers want from our world while not porting anything really interesting from their world (porting+open sourcing it): Visual Studio, Microsoft Office, etc etc.

In future we could easily end - hey, Microsoft has all what Linux has plus all other things, why choose Linux?

I know I will stay here, but I do wonder how this will impact our future - would love to be wrong on this, but history has shown otherwise (Apple and Google pretty much come into same basket as I see some DDs are proudly telling how they use OS X this days because it is "superb" and run Debian in VM - I wonder how much our Social Contract really means to them and our duty to defend FLOSS world).

Notice: I don't know if this is with free license pic, but today I don't even care because I don't support that world.
