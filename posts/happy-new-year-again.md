Yes again, I like it that way. Twice! Anyway, we have here what is called Serbian New Year (it is again, Orthodox by Julian calendar).

So, if you missed or think you can do better New Year's resolutions - feel free to join the party (just a notice, besides firework we have a lot of gun fire here during that time. A LOT.).

Advice for everyone's resolution list: be better version of yourself, have more happy days.

Cheers. (oh, yes, get more involved in Debian)
