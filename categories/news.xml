So instead writing thousand of words I just choose to make a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's pretty much clear what it is. Instead of that people should read LWN or I should start making news because it is not hard to be waaaay much better then Phoronix guy but also news that I didn't write I will not just link to it (many times not even that) and then say how I wrote article! You know, it is fine not to understand everything and ask people questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>linux</category><category>lwn</category><category>news</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/just-read-lwn-or-make-your-news.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2015 14:08:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
