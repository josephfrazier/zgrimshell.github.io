Mail or ping me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: After partnership with Microsoft, I lost interest and a bit of trust in Linux Foundation. After &lt;a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/39546.html"&gt;this move&lt;/a&gt; I am in total distrust with them and don't want them even represent Linux at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really care about FLOSS world and your community (thus being socially responsible person) please do donate to &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/"&gt;Software Freedom Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>heidelberg</category><category>linux</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/two-short-notes.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2016 10:06:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deepin switches to Debian Sid</title><link>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/deepin-switches-to-debian-sid.html</link><dc:creator>Zlatan Todoric</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distribution that I feel fond of their work on UX for Linux ecosystem has switched from Ubuntu to Debian. So now pabs will probably invite them to our Derivate Census and they start packaging their stack into Debian directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More about their latest RC release and the mention of switch is on their &lt;a href="http://blog.deepin.org/2015/12/deepin-15-rc-make-you-only-have-eyes-for-us-by-the-sincerity/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>debian</category><category>deepin</category><category>linux</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/deepin-switches-to-debian-sid.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2015 17:49:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Just read LWN or make your news</title><link>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/just-read-lwn-or-make-your-news.html</link><dc:creator>Zlatan Todoric</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it has been always a pain but lately going and (yes, my mistake) reading Phoronix news is just horrible (the best word I could choose, other were much more nasty). So instead writing thousand of words I just choose to make a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="moronix" src="https://zgrimshell.github.io/images/moronix.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's pretty much clear what it is. Instead of that people should read LWN or I should start making news because it is not hard to be waaaay much better then Phoronix guy but also news that I didn't write I will not just link to it (many times not even that) and then say how I wrote article! You know, it is fine not to understand everything and ask people questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>linux</category><category>lwn</category><category>news</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/just-read-lwn-or-make-your-news.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2015 14:08:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
