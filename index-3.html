<p>So it has been always a pain but lately going and (yes, my mistake) reading Phoronix news is just horrible (the best word I could choose, other were much more nasty). So instead writing thousand of words I just choose to make a picture.</p>
<p><img alt="moronix" src="images/moronix.jpg"></p>
<p>I think it's pretty much clear what it is. Instead of that people should read LWN or I should start making news because it is not hard to be waaaay much better then Phoronix guy but also news that I didn't write I will not just link to it (many times not even that) and then say how I wrote article! You know, it is fine not to understand everything and ask people questions.</p>

<p>By the help of sponsorship I managed again to attend the conference where Debian family gathers. This is going to be a mix without any particular order of everything, anything and nothing else ;)</p>
<p><img alt="attendance pic" src="images/debhere.jpg"></p>
<p>I arrived to Heidelberg Main Train Station around 9am on 15th August and almost right away found Debian people so it made my trip to hostel easier. After arrival I checked in but needed to wait for 3 hours to get the key (it seems that SA will not have that problem at all, which is already an improvement). Although waiting was 3 hours long, it wasn't actually difficult at all as I started hugging and saying hi to many old (the super old super friend of mine - moray, or how I call him, "doc") and new friends. I just must say - if you know or don't know Rhonda, try to get somehow into her hugs. With her hug I acknowledged that I really did arrive to reunion.</p>

<p>It's at least an interesting story that Microsoft celebrated Debian release.
Once arch enemy of Linux world, now obviously on their knees when they must do
such things to sustain their business model. Next stop, Microsoft goes open
source, and still nobody cares. Then they go out of business - and no one
cares. Maybe they survive as open hardware producer? ^_^</p>
