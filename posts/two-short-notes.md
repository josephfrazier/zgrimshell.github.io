First: I am in Heidelberg next ~10 days so if anyone wants to meet up for a beer, keysigning and chats about FLOSS world, I am very happy to do that. Mail or ping me!

Second: After partnership with Microsoft, I lost interest and a bit of trust in Linux Foundation. After [this move](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/39546.html) I am in total distrust with them and don't want them even represent Linux at all.

If you really care about FLOSS world and your community (thus being socially responsible person) please do donate to [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/supporter/).
