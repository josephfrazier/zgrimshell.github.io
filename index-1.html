<p>There is really hardly a better way to open a series of interviewing with
developers behind Free Libre Open Source Software project, then with
incredible mind such as Joey Hess. To write his contributions to Free software
ecosystem, especially in Debian, would be a book by itself. His impact exceeds
even his projects - people literally follow his blog posts to see what he is
doing and how is he living. A hacker from cabin. If you really need to have a
picture of true hacker, then Joey is the one. As this isn't a book I will just
mention few projects that he has been behind - git-annex, ikiwiki, etckeeper,
debian installer, parts of dpkg, debhelper, devscripts, taskel. So without
further waiting here it is.</p>

<p>First thing first. I went with Debian invitation letter to US embassy in
Sarajewo, got accepted and after few days my passport with US visa was with
me. Got booked ticket (with help of Steve Langasek) and bought my bus ticket
to Belgrade Airport (Nikola Tesla). As bus tour would be from Banja Luka
through Croatia (the highway) and then to Belgrade I needed some special
planning to do. To be honest I needed some special plan for whole trip. You
wonder why I needed special plan?! Well because I was bringing with me 9
liters of rakija. Yep you read it correctly - 9 liters of rakija. As in most
European countries (and especially EU, which Croatia is now part) allowed
quantity was to bring 1l of it. I wasn't much nervous about it (actually I
wasn't nervous at all I just didn't want to loose the rakija ;) ) as I already
had "bus-border" experience during my previous DebConf (DebConf13 in
Switzerland). So I packed all nine liters into my backpack and put it above
where I sat. In my suitcase (that is going in suitcase space inside bus) I put
my laptop from backpack. The suitcase would most probably be checked by border
police but the backpack shouldn't be.</p>

<p>Yep, thank you xkcd for love and thank you brain for being pain in the ass. I
decided to download all xkcd images and then watch them in slideshow. You
wouldn't believe that getting all images from xkcd is not an easy job. At
least not for begginer as me. And especially not if you just start to search
where are all the images.</p>

    <p>I had last night a dream. It was really bad - systemd took over the Linux
ecosystem, distributions became very similar and after some time every piece
of Free software gathered all their contributors in one place and they decided
to create one superb GNU/Linux OS with a manpower of all FLOSS contributors.
So now Google, Apple, Microsoft and all other parties that try to centralize
their power in world had an adversary of millions hackers forking ideas of
their software and creating by a magnitude better FLOSS equivalents and give
power to people. When I woke up I did a fsck do Google, Apple, Microsoft and
other parties exist still at all. All good - the world is same as it was
yesterday, people don't have the power (thanks to jobs)...</p>

<p>I have a simple faculty project where two lines intersect. To be more precise:
first line is defined by two points, second line is defined by point and
angle, all must be shown in plot presentation, given points should be marked
with "x" and intersection of two lines should also be marked with "x". I was
supposed to do it in Visual Basic but as I use only Debian - its a bummer. So
I choose to do it in Python. Lets get it started. Open your text editor.</p>
