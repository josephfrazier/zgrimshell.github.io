Free Software Foundation is also in process of funding and if you want them to shine still (or you simply love GNU manifesto or many other things this project has done for us in last 3 decades) then please support their [fund raising campaign](http://www.fsf.org/appeal?pk_campaign=2015-2016-fundraiser-banner-gnu&pk_kwd=appeal).

Lets create GNU world!
