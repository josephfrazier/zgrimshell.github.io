This is going to be a mix without any particular order of everything, anything and nothing else ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived to Heidelberg Main Train Station around 9am on 15th August and almost right away found Debian people so it made my trip to hostel easier. After arrival I checked in but needed to wait for 3 hours to get the key (it seems that SA will not have that problem at all, which is already an improvement). Although waiting was 3 hours long, it wasn't actually difficult at all as I started hugging and saying hi to many old (the super old super friend of mine - moray, or how I call him, "doc") and new friends. I just must say - if you know or don't know Rhonda, try to get somehow into her hugs. With her hug I acknowledged that I really did arrive to reunion.&lt;/p&gt;

It's going to be a bit long so anyone who isn't interested in my personal Debian journey should skip it. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007. I enrolled into Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (at first at
Department of Industrial Management and later transfered to Department of
Mechatronics - this was possible because first 3 semesters are same for both
departments). By the end of same year I was finishing my tasks (consisting
primarily of calculations, some small graphical designs and write-ups) when
famous virus, called by users "RECYCLER", sent my Windows XP machine into
oblivion. Not only it took control over machine and just spawned so many
processes that system would crash itself, it actually deleted all from hard-
disk before it killed the system entirely. I raged - my month old work, full
of precise calculations and a lot of design details, was just gone. I started
cursing which was always continued with weeping: "Why isn't there an OS that
can whithstand all of viruses, even if it looks like old DOS!". At that time,
my roommate was my cousin who had used Kubuntu in past and currently was
having SUSE dual-booted on his laptop. He called me over, started talking
about this thing called Linux and how it's different but de facto has no
viruses. Well, show me this Linux and my thought was, it's probably so ancient
and not used that it probably looks like from pre Windows 3.1 era, but when
SUSE booted up it had so much more beautiful UI look (it was KDE, and compared
to XP it looked like the most professional OS ever).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out— Because I was
not a Socialist.&lt;br&gt;
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt;
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.&lt;br&gt;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt;
Because I was not a Jew.&lt;br&gt;
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.&lt;/p&gt;
