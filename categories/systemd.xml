It was really bad - systemd took over the Linux
ecosystem, distributions became very similar and after some time every piece
of Free software gathered all their contributors in one place and they decided
to create one superb GNU/Linux OS with a manpower of all FLOSS contributors.
So now Google, Apple, Microsoft and all other parties that try to centralize
their power in world had an adversary of millions hackers forking ideas of
their software and creating by a magnitude better FLOSS equivalents and give
power to people. When I woke up I did a fsck do Google, Apple, Microsoft and
other parties exist still at all. All good - the world is same as it was
yesterday, people don't have the power (thanks to jobs)...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>floss</category><category>hackers</category><category>systemd</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/nightmare.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 19:57:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
