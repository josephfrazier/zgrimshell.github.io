The [Pepper and Carrot motion comic](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pepper-and-carrot-motion-comic#/) is almost funded. The pledge from [Ethic Cinema](http://ethiccinema.org/) put it on good road (as it seemed it would fail). Ethic Cinema is non profit organization that wants to make open source art (as they call it Libre Art). Purism's creative director, François Téchené, is member and co-founder of Ethic Cinema. Lets push final bits so we can get this free as in freedom artwork.

Notice that Pepper and Carrot is a webcomic (also available as book) free as in freedom artwork done by David Revoy who also [supports this campaign](http://www.peppercarrot.com/en/article380/motion-comic-project-by-nikolai-mamashev). Also the support is done by [Krita community on their landing page](https://krita.org/en/).

Lets do this!
